Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project Title: Role-based and User-friendly Tool for Managing
Device Lists and Bandwidth Allocations from Observium
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the product requirements for the development of a role-based and
user-friendly from Observium. The tool aims to facilitate the management of device lists and
bandwidth allocations, ensuring accurate data collection for peak and average bandwidth
analysis. Users will be empowered to customize the device list, append or remove devices
and sites, and view changes in the peak and average bandwidth report.
1.2 Scope
The feature will provide a comprehensive device management tool, enabling users to
optimize network performance and resource utilization. It will include the ability to append
and remove devices and sites, ensuring flexibility in customizing the device list. Additionally,
the implementation of a role-based access control system will enhance security and prevent
unauthorized modifications.
2. Objectives
2.1 Main Objectives
The primary objectives include:
● Development of a device management tool.
● Implementation of a role-based access control system.
● Enabling users to append and remove devices and sites.
● Providing visibility into changes in the peak and average bandwidth report.
● Retrieving average and peak bandwidth data from Observium.
● Displaying the data in a table format with columns for device name, average
bandwidth, peak bandwidth, and utilization.
● Implementing time range filters to enable users to analyze data for specific durations.
